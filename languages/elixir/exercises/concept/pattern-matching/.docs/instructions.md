This exercise includes a lot of simple functions and a few that are a bit more complex.

The Erlang [:calendar.universal_time/0](http://erlang.org/doc/man/calendar.html#universal_time-0) function can be used by Elixir to return the current UTC datetime as a tuple. Using pattern matching, convert the given tuples to strings.

Use the [String.pad_leading/3](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#pad_leading/3) function to pad days with zeros.
