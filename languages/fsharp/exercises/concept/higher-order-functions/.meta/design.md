# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of Higher-Order Functions in F#.

## Learning objectives

- Know how to define and read function types
- Know how to return functions
- Know how to pass functions as arguments
- Know how to define lambda functions
- Know how to assign functions to bindings
- Know that many built-in functions are higher-order functions

## Out of scope

- Recursion
- Mutually recursive functions
- Custom operators
- Monadic functions
- Function composition

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `higher-order-functions`: know how to return functions; know how to pass functions as arguments; know how to define lambda functions; know how to assign functions to bindings; know that many built-in functions are higher-order functions

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `basics`: know how to define functions.
