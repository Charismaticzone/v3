# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of hashes through [Ruby][ruby-doc-hash].

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, the student should:

- Know of the existence of the `hash` collection.
- Know how to create and initialise a `hash`.
- Know how to assign values to existing hash keys.
- Know how to add new hash key.
- Know how to iterate over a hash.

## Out of scope

- Enumerable methos like select, reject, compact, etc.
- Memory and performance characteristics.

## Concepts

- `hash`: know of the existence of the `hash` collection; know how to create and initialise a `hash`; know how to assign values to existing hash keys; know how to add new hash key; know how to iterate over a hash.

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `strings`: log lines are `String` values.

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific logic to be added to the [analyzer][analyzer].
